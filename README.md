# table_reservation_system
Practice project that mocks internal table reservation system for nightclubs.

Run the project using node app.js and open browser on localhost:3000. Use either of the credentials found from users.json

Things on the TODO-list:
-Two way encryption when transfering data (Crytpo/Crypto-js)
-Use actual API key for the session and store it in .env (read from .env also)
-Use Database instead of .JSON -files for storing data (SQL/MongoDB)
-Try using jwt instead of Express own solution
-Refactor main.js
-Improve the UI (React/Vue?)
